## Objective
- To create a responsive card.
- Technologies used: HTML, CSS, React.js

## Project Description
- Component.js is the target file and it's CSS is Component.css
- This Component.js can be imported anywhere easily.
- Text areas are <b>dynamic</b>, they scale based on content length.
- For responsiveness, I have used <b>'rem'</b> units for some elements and values in <b>'percentage'</b> for remaining elements. 
- On clicking the Follow button, the color of button changes when button is in <b>pressed state</b> and title of button changes to <b>Unfollow</b> when button is released.
- The button colors for Follow and Unfollow states are different.
- Used <b>useEffect</b> and <b>useState</b> hooks in the assignment.
- Created a function for keeping the font color of <b>Hashtags</b> blue.
	Here I have used regex to find the words that start with '#' and replaced them with a div which has blue font color. 
- I have used child selector to design the Profile / Display Picture.
